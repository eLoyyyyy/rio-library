# CRUD Exercise

## Rio's Library
Rio has recently opened his new library, and he has just got his first set of books. He wants to be able to catalogue all books coming in and out of his library.

## Main Objective
Create an application that displays and stores all the book information (Title, Author, Genre, Library Section) that's currently in the catalogue of Rio's Library

## Additional Info:
### Genre examples: 
- Horror
- Romance
- Thriller
- etc...

### Library Section:
- Circulation
- Periodical Section
- General Reference
- Children's Section
- Fiction

## Impress Us:
- Add in a searching/filtering feature where users could check all books under a specific filter. (Search/Filter by Book Title, Author, Library Section)
- Add a book borrowing feature, where the user can mark a book as borrowed/returned. If a book is borrowed, it will not display in any search/filter results.

## Notes:
- The design of the app is up to you but use Twitter Bootstrap.
- Use any PHP framework you want.
- Impress us - section is optional but would impress us ;)

>Good Luck!
